## About the project
BLUF: This project is incomplete. There were so many things we wanted to implement, but there was not enough time. 
This is a text based adventure game built using Java. In this game, an explorere is looking for the final piece to a puzzle that will show them where a treasure can be found. The object of the game is to solve riddles, answer trivia questions, and win mini games to obtain the tools that will be needed to defeat the final boss. Once that boss has been defeated, the player will get that final clue to discover the treasure's location.

## What We Wanted to do
- Have three levels of games for each type of challenge. Nine games in total, three for trivia, three for riddles, and three mini games
- Have a timer function 
- Have the player obtain enhanced weapons and armor as the levels got harder
- Implement hints with harder levels
- Have the player play to defeat a final boss
- Have a final prize if the boss was defeated

## What We Accomplished
- Implemented one type of game for each level
- Player could obtain weapons, but no enhancements
- The final boss was not implemented, thus no final prize could be obtained

## What We Learned
- How to implement scrum practices
- How to sprints work
- The different between a user story and a task
  - Spoiler alert: User stories are testable, tasks are not
- How to work as a team on user stories to provide a minimum viable prodcut for each sprint release
- How to prioritize user stories and understand what was possible, and what was not
- How to stick to a user story and not add additional code that could go on a different user story
- How to communicate with the customer to ensure we were on track with what they required

## Back to the Future
Some things I would come back to finish when I can: 
- Add an ending so the player can either win or lose
- Add the additional games
- Add the timer feature
- Add hints and enhanced rewards

## Thank You!!
Thanks for taking the time to read this and review my code. I hope to circle back to this and update this readme with changes. For now, the jar files to check the game out are in the tags area.
